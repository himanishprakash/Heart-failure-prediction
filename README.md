# Heart Failure Mortality Prediction

## Overview

This project employs advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze clinical data for predicting mortality due to heart failure. By utilizing a dataset with 13 predictive attributes from the NIH, our goal is to enhance the prediction accuracy of heart failure mortality, ultimately aiming to improve healthcare decision-making processes and patient care strategies.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using clinical and demographic data to accurately forecast heart failure, supporting healthcare providers in early detection and personalized management of heart failure risks.

## Background and Domain Knowledge

Heart failure affects over six million adults in the United States, marking it as a significant public health issue. The condition occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to meet the body's demand for blood and oxygen. Our project seeks to address this challenge by offering predictive insights into heart failure, guiding healthcare providers in preemptive interventions.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises medical records of 299 heart failure patients, including demographic and clinical data such as age, anemia presence, creatinine_phosphokinase levels, and more, without any missing values.

## Methodology

### Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis

We conducted an initial analysis focusing on data processing and exploratory data analysis, including correlation matrices and distributions of key variables.

### Machine Learning Implementation

Our approach includes several machine learning models to address the prediction task:

- **Lasso Logistic Regression** 
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** 
- **Decision Trees** 
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** 
- **Neural Networks** 

### Insights and Model Performance

The Lasso Logistic Regression model demonstrated significant predictive accuracy, emphasizing the importance of feature selection. Our findings underscore the potential of machine learning in improving heart failure mortality predictions.

## Recommendations and Business Value

We propose strategic recommendations such as implementing early screening programs and personalized patient management plans, leveraging the predictive model to improve healthcare outcomes.

## Summary and Conclusions

Our project highlights the transformative potential of machine learning in healthcare, particularly in the early detection and management of heart failure. Future directions include refining the predictive model, validating its effectiveness, and exploring integration into healthcare systems.
